## Packaging

Packaging means creating a package that can be installed by `pip`.

There are many ways to create an installable package, and many ways to distribute it.

We will show how to create a package using `hatchling`, and how to distribute it on GitHub, PyPI and a private PyPI server.

## Benefits of packaging

::: {.incremental}

* Distribute your package to others
* Install your package with `pip`
* Specify dependencies
* Reproducibility
* Specify version
* Release vs. development versions

:::


## Packaging workflow

1. Create a `pyproject.toml` in the root folder of the project
2. Build a package (e.g. `myproject-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`)
3. Upload the package to location, where others can find it

## `pyproject.toml` {.scrollable}

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "my_library"
version = "0.0.1"
dependencies = [
    "numpy"
]

authors = [
  { name="First Last", email="initials@dhigroup.com" },
]
description = "Useful library"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest", "ruff", "mypy", "mkdocs", "mkdocstrings[python]", "mkdocs-material"]
test= ["pytest"]

[project.urls]
"Homepage" = "https://github.com/DHI/my_library"
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/DHI/my_library/issues"
```

## Versioning {.smaller}



Versioning your package is important for reproducibility and to avoid breaking changes.

. . .

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) use three numbers `{major}.{minor}.{patch}`, e.g. `1.1.0`

::: {.incremental}

* A new *major* version indicates **breaking** changes
* A new *minor* version indicates new *features*, without breaking changes
* A new *patch* version indicates a *small* change, e.g. a bug fix
* Each of the numbers can be higher than 9, e.g. `1.0.0` is more recent than `0.24.12`

:::

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/scikit.png)
:::
::::

## Version 1.0

::: {.incremental}

* A version number of `1.0` indicates that the package is ready for production
* The API is stable, and breaking changes will only be introduced in new major versions
* The package is well tested, and the documentation is complete
* Start with version `0.1.0` and increase the version number as you add features

:::

## Breaking changes

What is a breaking change?

::: {.incremental}

* Removing a function
* Changing the name of a function
* Changing the signature of a function (arguments, types, return value)

:::

. . .

Try to avoid breaking changes, if possible, but if you do, increase the major version number! 


## Installing specific versions

* `pip install my_library` will install the latest version
* `pip install my_library==1.0.0` will install version 1.0.0
* `pip install my_library>=1.0.0` will install version 1.0.0 or higher


## Pre-release versions {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

* Versions that are not ready for production
* Indicated by a suffix, e.g. `1.0.0rc1`
* Will not be installed by default
* Can be installed with `pip install my_library==1.0.0rc1`
* Listed on PyPI, but not on the search page

## Understanding Software Licenses

- A software license is a legal agreement that grants users certain rights and imposes restrictions on the use, modification, and distribution of a software package.
- Specifying a license for your Python package is crucial, as it determines how others can legally use and interact with your code.
- If you don't specify a license, your package is effectively "all rights reserved," making it legally unusable by others.
 - Check that your dependencies have a license! 


## Common Open-Source License Types

- **MIT License**: Highly permissive, allows commercial use, modification, and distribution with minimal restrictions.
- **BSD-3 Clause License**: Similar to MIT, but includes a clause prohibiting use of the name for endorsement.
- **Apache License 2.0**: Includes a patent grant and is compatible with the GPL family of licenses.
- **GNU GPL Family (GPL, LGPL, AGPL)**: Copyleft licenses that require derivative works to be open-source and distributed under the same terms.

Many popular Python packages, such as scikit-learn, use licenses like BSD-3 or Apache 2.0.


## Licenses for internal packages

- For internal packages that will not be distributed outside your organization:
- You can use a simple copyright notice instead of a full license
- Example copyright notice:
```
# Copyright (c) [COMPANY NAME]
# All rights reserved.
```
- The copyright notice can be placed in the header of each Python file
- Avoids the need to maintain a separate license file


## Choosing and Implementing a License

- When using open-source dependencies in internal packages:
 - Check the licenses of your dependencies and ensure compatibility
 - Document the licenses of all third-party components in your project
- Resources for learning more about licenses:
 - [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)
 - [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses)
 - [Software Licenses on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license)

By following these practices, you can effectively manage the licensing for both your internal and publicly distributed Python packages.




## Dependencies

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

**Application**

*A program that is run by a user*

* command line tool
* script
* web application

Pin versions to ensure reproducibility, e.g. `numpy==1.11.0`
:::

::: {.column}

**Library**

*A program that is used by another program*

* Python package
* Low level library (C, Fortran, Rust, ...)

Make the requirements as loose as possible, e.g. `numpy>=1.11.0`
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Make the requirements loose, to avoid conflicts with other packages.

```{.toml code-line-numbers="8-10|27-29"}
[build-system]

name = "my_library"
version = "0.0.1"

::: {.notes}

* Mandatory dependencies are specified in the `dependencies` section.
* Optional dependencies are specified in the `optional-dependencies` section.

## Classifiers


```{.toml file=pyproject.toml}
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering",
]
```

* Classifiers are used to categorize your package
* Less relevant for internal packages
* Operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
* Development status (Alpha, Beta, Production/Stable)


## Packaging non-Python files

* Including non-Python files can be useful for e.g. machine learning models.
* If you use `hatchling`, you can include non-Python files in your package.
* `hatchling` uses .gitignore to determine which files to include.


## GitHub secrets

* Store sensitive information, e.g. passwords, in your repository.
* Secrets are encrypted, and only visible to you and GitHub Actions.
* Add secrets in the repository settings.


To use secrets as environment variables in GitHub Actions, add them to the `env` section of the workflow:

```yaml
env:
  USERNAME: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
  PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
```

## GitHub Actions {.smaller}

* Modern publishing uses Trusted Publishers.
* Avoids managing secrets in the repository.

```{.yaml filename=.github/workflows/python_publish.yml code-line-numbers="|2-4|18-19|20-21"}
name: Publish Python Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build
    - name: Build package
      run: python -m build
    - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

## Publishing to PyPI and TestPyPI {.smaller}

* PyPI is the Python Package Index, where you can publish your package.
* TestPyPI is a test version of PyPI for trying out publish workflows.
* Only publish to PyPI when you are ready to release a new version.

. . .

Example:

```{.yaml filename=.github/workflows/python_publish.yml code-line-numbers="|3-4|5-6"}
    - name: Build package
      run: python -m build
    - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
          repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```



## Private PyPI server {.smaller}

* Private packages can be be hosted on e.g. Azure Arfifacts or Posit Package Manager.
* These servers behaves like PyPI, and can be used with `pip`
* Access policies can be used to control who can install packages.

. . .

Example:

```{.bash code-line-numbers="|2"}
$ pip install --extra-index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dhigroup/_packaging/pond/pypi/simple/ sampling
Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dhigroup/_packaging/pond/pypi/simple/
...
Successfully installed sampling-0.0.1
```

## Installing a development version

* Install latest dev version, e.g. `pip install https://github.com/DHI/mikeio/archive/main.zip`
* Install from `fix-interp` branch, e.g. `pip install https://github.com/DHI/mikeio/archive/fix-interp.zip`

## Git, Pull Requests, and code reviews {.smaller}

## Github flow {background-color="white" .smaller .incremental}

![](images/git_workflow.png)

1. Create a branch
2. Make changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Review
5. Merge


## Github best practices

* Commit often
* Use descriptive commit messages
* Keep pull requests small and focused
* Use "issues" to track work
* Review code regularly

## Python functions, classes, and modules {.smaller}

## Functions as black boxes

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A(Input A) --> F["Black box"]
    B(Input B) -->  F
    F --> O(Output)

    style F fill:#000,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```  

* A function is a black box that takes some input and produces some output.
* The input and output can be anything, including other functions.
* As long as the input and output are the same, the function body can be modified.

## Naming conventions - general

* Use lowercase characters
* Separate words with underscores

```python
model_name = "NorthSeaModel"
n_epochs = 100

def my_function():
    pass
```

## Constants

* Use all uppercase characters

```python
GRAVITY = 9.81

AVOGADRO_CONSTANT = 6.02214076e23

SECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 86400

N_LEGS_PER_ANIMAL = {
    "human": 2,
    "dog": 4,
    "spider": 8,
}
```


## Classes

* Use CamelCase for the name of the class
* Use lowercase characters for the name of the methods
* Separate words with underscores


```python
class RandomClassifier:

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.classes_ = np.unique(y)

    def predict(self, X):
        return np.random.choice(self.classes_, size=len(X))

    def fit_predict(self, X, y):
        self.fit(X, y)
        return self.predict(X)
```

## Dataclasses {.smaller}

```python
import datetime
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Interval:
    start: date
    end: date

>>> dr1 = Interval(start=datetime.date(2020, 1, 1), end=datetime.date(2020, 1, 31))
>>> dr1
Interval(start=datetime.date(2020, 1, 1), end=datetime.date(2020, 1, 31))
>>> dr2 = Interval(start=datetime.date(2020, 1, 1), end=datetime.date(2020, 1, 31))
>>> dr1 == dr2
True
```



## Types, abstraction, and refactoring {.smaller}

## Pythonic

If you want your code to be Pythonic, you have to be familiar with these types and their methods.

Dundermethods:

* `__getitem__`
* `__setitem__`
* `__len__`
* `__contains__`
* ... 

---

```python
class JavaLikeToolbox:
    
    def getToolByName(self, name: str) -> Tool:
        for tool in self.tools:
            if tool.name == name:
                return tool

    def numberOfTools(self) -> int:
        return len(self.tools)

>>> tb = JavaLikeToolbox([Hammer(), Screwdriver()])
>>> tb.getToolByName("hammer")
Hammer()
>>> tb.numberOfTools()
2
```

---

```python
class Toolbox:

    def __getitem__(self, name: str) -> Tool:
        return self._tools[name]
    
    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.tools)

>>> tb = Toolbox([Hammer(), Screwdriver()])
>>> tb["hammer"]
Hammer()
>>> len(tb)
2
```


## Duck typing

* "*If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck*"
* From the perspective of the caller, it doesn't matter if it is a rubber duck or a real duck.
* The type of the object is **not important**, as long as it has the right methods.

---

An example is a Scikit learn transformers

* `fit`
* `transform`
* `fit_transform`

If you want to make a transformer compatible with sklearn, you have to implement these methods.

---

```python
class MyTransformer:
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # do something
        return self

    def transform(self, X):
        # do something
        return X

    def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):
        return self.fit(X, y).transform(X)
```


## Testing and auto-formatting {.smaller}

## Unit testing

::: {.callout-note}
## Definition "Unit"

* A small, fundamental piece of code.
* Executed in isolation with appropriate inputs.
::: 

* A function is typically considered a "unit"
* Lines of code within functions are smaller (can't be isolated)
* Classes are considered bigger (but can be treated as units)


## A **good** unit test {.smaller}


* Fully automated
* Has full control over all the pieces running ("fake" external dependencies)
* Can be run in any order 
* Runs in memory (no DB or file access, for example)
* Consistently returns the same result (no random numbers)
* Runs fast
* Tests a single logical concept in the system
* Readable
* Maintainable
* Trustworthy


## Thank you!
