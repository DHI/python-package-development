## Module 4: GitHub actions and auto-formatting

- Create new branch "action-formatting" (Make sure changes from last module have been merged, and that you start from the main branch)
- 4.1 Github Action
    - 5.1.1 Copy the GitHub action "python-app.yml" from the python template https://github.com/DHI/template-python-library to your own library (make sure it sits in the same folder).
    - 5.1.2 Change all occurrences of "my_library" in the yml file to your package name "tscleaner"
    - 5.1.3 Comment out the line with "ruff-action" with "#"
    - 5.1.4 Commit, push and create a pull request; the tests should now run, verify that they all run before you move on
- 4.2 Ruff
    - 5.2.1 Enable the "ruff-action" be removing the "#" you added above
    - 5.2.2 Commit and push, your actions will probably fail now - inspect the problems by clicking the red cross (did you also get an email?)
    - 5.2.3 Install "ruff" on your local machine with mamba/conda/pip
    - 5.2.4 Navigate to your project root folder and run ruff with "ruff ."
    - 5.2.5 Add `__all__ = ["SpikeCleaner", "FlatPeriodCleaner", "OutOfRangeCleaner", "plot_timeseries"]` to your `__init__.py` file and fix remaining issues until ruff passes
    - 5.2.6 Commit, push and verify that you action now succeeds
- 4.3 Black
    - 5.3.1 Install "black" on your local machine with mamba/conda/pip
    - 5.3.2 Run black from your project root folder; inspect the differences; commit
- 4.4 pyproject.toml
    - Copy the pyproject.toml from the python template https://github.com/DHI/template-python-library (this file will replace your setup.py)
    - Modify to fit your package
    - Remove the setup.py
    - Commit, push and verify that the GitHub action runs
    - If it fails, you probably forgot some dependencies - go back and fix
    - [Optional] You should also re-install your local package with ">pip install --upgrade -e ."
- 4.5 [Optional] Enable black and ruff extensions in VSCode; set black to run on save
- Create pull request in GitHub and "request review" from your reviewers
- Get feedback, Adjust code until approval, then merge (and delete branch)
