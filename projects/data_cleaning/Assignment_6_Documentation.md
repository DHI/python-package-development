### Module 6 Assignment: Documentation

#### Objective:
Enhance your project's documentation with mkdocs and docstrings. Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness to aid users and contributors in understanding and utilizing the project effectively.

#### Tasks:

### 1. **Docstrings:**

Revamp the README file to provide essential information about the project, its usage, and contributions.


   **Subtasks:**
   - Include installation instructions and a usage examples.


### 2. **Docstrings:**
   Implement Numpy-style docstrings, ensuring detailed, clear, and standardized documentation of functions and classes.

   **Subtasks:**
   - Revise existing docstrings to adhere to the Numpy-style format, detailing descriptions, parameters, returns, and exceptions.
   - Ensure all functional elements, including edge cases, are well-documented to aid in understanding and usage.

### 3. **mkdocs:**
   Utilize mkdocs to create a well-structured, informative, and navigable static website for your project’s documentation.

   **Subtasks:**
   - Install mkdocstrings and the chosen theme (e.g., material).
   - Configure mkdocs utilizing `mkdocs.yml` (in a subfolder docs), ensuring the inclusion of the mkdocstrings plugin with Numpy-style set as the docstring style.
   - Create and organize markdown files to ensure comprehensive and structured documentation.

### 4. **API Documentation:**
   Leverage mkdocstrings to auto-generate API documentation, ensuring it’s detailed, clear, and user-friendly.

   **Subtasks:**
   - Ensure API documentation is automatically generated and updated with mkdocstrings.
   - Review the generated documentation for clarity, completeness, and structure.

### 5. **GitHub:**
   Commit the enhanced docstrings and mkdocs configurations to your GitHub repository, and open a pull request.

   **Subtasks:**
   - Summarize the enhancements made, highlighting the transition to Numpy-style docstrings and the implementation of mkdocs.
   - Ensure the static website displays appropriately and is accessible via GitHub or a specified host.

#### Example:

**Numpy-Style Docstring:**
```python
def spike_check(data, threshold=5):
    """
    Identify and handle spikes in the dataset.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.Series
        The timeseries data to clean.
    threshold : int, optional
        The value above which a data point is considered a spike, default is 5.
    
    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        The cleaned timeseries data with spikes identified and handled.
    """
    ...
```

**mkdocs.yml Configuration:**
```yaml
site_name: my_library

theme: "material"

plugins:
- mkdocstrings:
    handlers:
      python:
        options:
          show_source: false
          heading_level: 2
          docstring_style: "numpy"
```

#### Submission:
Open a pull request and participate in the peer review process, incorporating and providing feedback to enhance the project's documentation's clarity, comprehensiveness, and accessibility.
