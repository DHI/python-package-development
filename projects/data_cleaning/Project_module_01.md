## Module 1: GitHub and basic functions

- 1.1 GitHub repo
    - 1.1.1 Create a new GitHub repository "timeseriescleaner"
        - private, no template, add readme, gitignore python, no license
    - 1.1.2 Go to repo settings/Collaborators add your instructors and your "buddy"
    - 1.1.3 Clone repo to local machine
    - [Optional] Create virtual environment for this course project (use venv or mamba/conda environment)
    - 1.1.4 Download the provided Python script and add it to the repo
    - 1.1.5 Commit the file and push the changes (Check that the file can be found on GitHub)
    - 1.1.6 Open the project in vscode and make a single character change to the file (add a comment)
    - 1.1.7 Commit the changes (Check that it works on GitHub)
- 1.2 Functions
    - 1.2.1 Create a local branch "refactor-functions"
    - 1.2.2 Refactor the code to use functions (`clean_spikes`, `clean_outofrange`, `clean_flat`, `plot_timeseries`)        
        - for data in [data1, data2, data3]:
            - data_original = data.copy()
            - data = clean_spikes(data, max_jump=10)
            - data = clean_outofrange(data, min_val=0, max_val=50)
            - data = clean_flat(data, flat_period=5)
            - plot_timeseries(data_original, data)
    - 1.2.3 Check that your code and produce the same results as before (you should not change the functionality!)
    - 1.2.4 Commit your code in 1 or more commits (in the end your code should be approximately 75 lines long)
- Create a pull request in GitHub and "request review" from your reviewers
- Wait for feedback, Adjust code until approval, then merge (and delete branch)
