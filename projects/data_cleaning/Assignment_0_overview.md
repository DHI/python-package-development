## **2. Functions, Classes, and Modules**

2.1 Add default arguments to the functions.
2.2 Move cleaner functions into a separate module.
2.3 Move the plotting function into a separate module.
2.4 Create main.py to execute the cleaning and plotting.  
2.5 Organize the functions into appropriate classes.  
2.6 Download the notebook_A and make sure it runs.

## **3. Object-oriented design**

3.1 Add type hints to all functions and methods.  
3.2 Implement a dataclass.
3.3 Implement inheritance and composition where appropriate. TODO
3.4 Adapt notebook_A to use the new classes.

## **4. Exceptions and Testing**

4.1 Organize the files into folders and add setup.py. Call your package tscleaner.
4.2 Install the package in editable mode.
4.3 Download notebook_B and make sure it runs.
4.4 Raise exceptions for invalid inputs.
4.5 Write unit tests with pytest.
4.6 Assess the test coverage.


## **5. Formatting and GitHub Actions**

5.1 Install black and ruff.
5.2 Format the code with black.
5.3 Check the code with ruff and fix any issues.
5.4 Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run the tests and format the code.
5.5 Verify that the workflow runs successfully.


## **6. Documentation**

6.1 Write a README file with basic information about the project.
6.2 Write NumPy style docstrings for all functions and classes.  
6.3 Install mkdocs and mkdocstrings.
6.4 Create a mkdocs.yml file and configure mkdocstrings.
6.5 Create a docs folder and add a markdown file for each module.
6.6 Create API documentation locally using mkdocs.
6.7 Check the generated HTML documentation.  


## **7. Publish Your Python Package**

7.1 Create pyproject.toml (instead of setup.py).
7.2 Build the package with hatchling.
7.3 Publish the package to the PyPI Test Server.
