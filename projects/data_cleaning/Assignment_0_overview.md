# Course project: Time Series Data Cleaning

## **1. GitHub and Basic Workflows**

1.1 Download the provided Python script.  
1.2 Create a new GitHub repository and upload the script.  
1.3 Practice cloning, committing, and pushing changes.

## **2. Functions, Classes, and Modules**

2.1 Refactor the code to use functions for cleaning time series data.  
2.2 Implement range, spike, and flat period checks using functions.  
2.3 Add default arguments for flexibility.  
2.4 Visualize the cleaned data alongside outliers.  
2.5 Organize the functions into appropriate classes.  
2.6 Separate the classes into different module files.  
2.7 Ensure the code remains functional and clean.

## **3. Type Hints and Refactor Code**

3.1 Add type hints to all functions and methods.  
3.2 Refactor the code for enhanced readability and maintainability.  
3.3 Implement inheritance and composition where appropriate.

## **4. Exception Handling, Testing, and Formatting**

4.1 Add exception handling to manage potential errors gracefully.  
   4.1.1 Identify possible errors and handle them.  
   4.1.2 Include user warnings where necessary.  
4.2 Develop unit tests using pytest.  
   4.2.1 Include tests for each cleaning technique.  
   4.2.2 Ensure full test coverage.  
4.3 Implement auto-formatting with tools like Black or ruff.

## **5. Dependencies and GitHub Actions**

5.1 Create a "timeseriescleaner" subfolder and include an `__init__.py` file.  
5.2 List all dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.  
5.3 Implement GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration.

## **6. Documentation**

6.1 Write comprehensive NumPy style docstrings for all functions and classes.  
6.2 Create API documentation locally using mkdocs.  
   6.2.1 Install mkdocs and mkdocstrings.  
   6.2.2 Check the generated HTML documentation.  
6.3 Update the README file with comprehensive information.

## **7. Publish Your Python Package**

7.1 Prepare your package, ensuring itâ€™s well-organized and documented.  
7.2 Publish the package to the PyPI Test Server.  
7.3 Update the GitHub repository with the final version of the project.
