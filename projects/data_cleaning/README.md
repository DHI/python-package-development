# Course project: Time Series Data Cleaning

Imagine this: you're given a script by a colleague and your task is to make usable for others in your organization; to make a proper package with a good structure, tests and documentation. And with a design that will make it easy to extend and maintain in the future.  

In this project, the script removes bad data from three different time series using three different algorithms: out-of-range, spikes, and flat-periods. Your colleague is not the best Python coder, so you will start by cleaning up the code, using functions and gradually from there improve the quality.
