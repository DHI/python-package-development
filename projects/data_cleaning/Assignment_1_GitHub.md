# Assignment 1: Setting up Your GitHub Repository

## Objective:
Initiate your course project by downloading the provided Python script and practicing basic Git and GitHub workflows. By the end of this module, you should have a repository set up with the script, ready for future refactoring and improvements.

## Steps:

1. **Download the Python Script:**
   - Download the `clean_project_data_v4_final2.py` script provided in the course material.

2. **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
    - Go to your personal GitHub account and create a new repository named `timeseries-cleaning`.
    - Initialize it with a README if desired.

3. **Clone the Repository Locally:**
    - Clone the repository to your local machine.
    - Copy the `clean_project_data_v4_final2.py` script into the local repository folder.

4. **Add the Script to Your Repository:**
    - Use the `git add` command to stage the script for commit.
    - Commit the file to your local repository with a meaningful commit message using the `git commit` command.

5. **Push the Commit to GitHub:**
    - Push the commit to the remote repository on GitHub using the `git push` command.
    - Ensure that the script is visible in your GitHub repository online.

6. **Verify:**
    - Ensure that the script is present and visible on your GitHub repository.
    - The repository should be ready for future development and collaboration.

7. **(Optional) Practice Branching:**
    - Create a new branch using the `git branch` command.
    - Switch to the new branch using the `git checkout` command.
    - Make a minor modification to the README or add a new file, commit the change, and push the branch to GitHub.
    - View the branch on GitHub to confirm the changes have been pushed.

## Submission:

- Share the link to your GitHub repository with the instructors for verification.
- Ensure the `clean_project_data_v4_final2.py` script is present in the main branch of the repository.

## Evaluation:

- The repository should be set up with the provided script.
- Commits should be executed with clear, descriptive messages.
- **Branching (Optional, 20%):** Successful creation and push of an additional branch with minor modifications.

#### Deadline:
- Ensure the GitHub repository is set up and the link shared by [specific date and time].

## Final remarks

This initial setup will serve as the foundation for your course project. Future assignments will involve refactoring and improving the code within this repository, and collaborating with peers via GitHub. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the basic Git commands and GitHub workflows, as they will be instrumental in subsequent modules. Happy coding!
