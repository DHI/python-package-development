# Assignment 3: Type Hints and Code Refactoring

## Objective:
The primary focus of this module is to enhance the code from Module 2 by introducing type hints for better readability and robustness. Additionally, you are expected to refactor the code to improve its efficiency, organization, and overall quality.

## Assignment Details:

1. **Implement Type Hints:**
    - Add type hints to all functions and methods within your code.
    - Ensure the appropriate use of built-in and custom types.

2. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Optimize the logic and structure of your code to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.
    - Enhance code readability and maintenance, ensuring it adheres to Python best practices.

3. **Error Handling:**
    - Introduce mechanisms to handle potential errors and exceptions during the data cleaning process.
    - Ensure that your code can gracefully handle unexpected inputs or issues.

4. **Update GitHub Repository:**
    - Commit the updated code to your GitHub repository.
    - Ensure the commit message clearly communicates the changes made.

5. **Pull Request:**
    - Open a pull request and provide a detailed explanation of the enhancements and improvements made to the code.

## Tasks:

1. **Type Hints:**
    - Enhance every function and method with type hints to indicate the expected input and output types.

```python
def clean_data(data: pd.Series, threshold: float) -> pd.Series:
    ...
```

2. **Code Refactoring:**
    - Evaluate your code, identify areas for improvement, and refactor them for optimized performance and readability.
    - Aim to make the code more concise, efficient, and Pythonic.

3. **Error and Exception Handling:**
    - Implement try-except blocks or conditional statements to manage potential errors, ensuring that the program doesn't crash with unexpected inputs.

```python
try:
    # Data cleaning process
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Submission Process:

1. **Code Review:**
    - Participate in the code review process, both as a reviewer and a reviewee. 
    - Consider feedback received and make necessary adjustments to enhance your code.

2. **Pull Request:**
    - Ensure your pull request is descriptive, highlighting the key changes and improvements made.

Dive into the assignment with the goal of enhancing code quality, ensuring type safety, and fostering efficient and readable code. Happy coding!
