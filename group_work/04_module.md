## Module 04

- Q1:  In your course project homework from last module, you separated the classes into separate files, how did it go? In some programming language, the convention is to put each class into a separate file, it this always a good practice? 
- Q2: One of the goals with this course is to be able to create software in a collaborative way, have you experienced or can you image any challenges with creating software in a collaborative way? What could be done to mitigate these challenges?
- Q3: Have you have problems with conflicting dependencies in the past? (E.g. some library needs a specific version of another library, but you need a different version of the same library for another part of your code.) How did you solve it?
