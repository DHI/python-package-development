## Module 06

- Q1: What is good documentation for you? Have you come across a software library or application that was well documented. Why did you find the documentation useful (e.g. examples ready to copy/paste? When you start using a new library, what is most important to get you started? 
- Q2: What belongs in a README on GitHub, and what belongs in user-facing documentation? How do the audiences differ?
- Q3: How can you collect useful feedback from users of your package? What methods or tools could help you improve your documentation based on that feedback?
